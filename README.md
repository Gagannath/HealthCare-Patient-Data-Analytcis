# HealthCare-Patient-Data-Analytics

## Overview
This project leverages data analytics to uncover critical insights in patient care, treatment effectiveness, and healthcare disparities. Using structured queries and statistical methods, we analyze patient diagnoses, medication usage, readmission trends, and medical procedures to guide clinical decision-making and improve healthcare outcomes.

## Key Analyses & Insights
Identifying High-Risk Patients: Flags patients with multiple diagnoses, prolonged hospital stays, and extensive medication use to aid in targeted interventions.
Primary Diagnoses Ranking: Determines the most prevalent conditions, with a notable focus on cardiovascular diseases like heart failure and ischemic heart disease.
Readmission Analysis: Examines whether patients with more diagnoses are more likely to be readmitted within 30 days, providing insights into post-hospitalization care needs.
Gender & Race-Based Trends: Investigates disparities in healthcare utilization, helping tailor interventions for diverse patient demographics.
Medication & Lab Test Patterns: Tracks medication prescriptions (e.g., insulin usage) and lab procedures by specialty and race to highlight healthcare service patterns.
Medical Specialties & Procedure Intensity: Identifies high-procedure specialties like cardiovascular surgery, optimizing resource allocation and hospital workflow.

## Impact & Applications

The findings from this analysis empower healthcare professionals to prioritize high-risk patients, refine treatment plans, and allocate medical resources more effectively. By applying data-driven insights, this project contributes to improving patient care, reducing hospital readmissions, and addressing healthcare inequities.
